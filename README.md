# ðŸ§¬ SmoothLife & Game of Life in C

This project is a C-based implementation of two fascinating cellular automata:

- **Conway's Game of Life** â€” the classic zero-player game simulating life-like evolution on a grid.
- **SmoothLife** â€” a continuous generalization of Game of Life, designed by Stephan Rafler, where cells evolve based on smooth transitions and convolution-based rules.

It was built as a hands-on exercise to learn the C programming language and explore algorithmic simulation.

## ðŸ§  What Is SmoothLife?

SmoothLife extends Conwayâ€™s discrete rules to a continuous domain:
- Instead of binary alive/dead states, cells have values between 0 and 1.
- Evolution is governed by convolution kernels and smooth transition functions.
- It allows for more fluid, organic patterns â€” like gliders that morph and flow.
